## A student grade generator, a speed detector and a net salary calculator.

## A student grade generator

This program prompts a user to input a student's grade which ranges from 0 to 100 and outputs a matching grade.

## A speed detector

This program uses a speed limit of 70km per hour to check for speeding violations. It deducts a single point for every 5km travelled above the speed limit and outputs the total amount of points deducted.

## A net salary calculator

This program utilizes a user's input of monthly gross pay and benefits to calculate their net pay after deducting taxes and various deductions.

Please grade kindly :)
